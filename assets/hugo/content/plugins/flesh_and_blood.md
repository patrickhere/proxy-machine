This plugin reads a decklist, fetches card art from [Fabrary](https://fabrary.net/), and puts the card images into the proper `game/` directories.

This plugin supports decklist exports from [Fabrary](https://fabrary.net/). To learn more, see [here](#formats).

## Basic Instructions

Navigate to the root directory as plugins are not meant to be run in the plugins directory.

If you're on macOS or Linux, open **Terminal**. If you're on Windows, open **PowerShell**.

Create and start your virtual Python environment and install Python dependencies if you have not done so already. See [here]({{% ref "../docs/create/#basic-usage" %}}) for more information.

Put your decklist into a text file in `game/decklist`. In this example, the filename is `deck.txt` and the decklist format is Fabrary (`fabrary`).

Run the script.

```sh
python plugins/flesh_and_blood/fetch.py game/decklist/deck.txt fabrary
```

Now you can create the PDF using [`create_pdf.py`]({{% ref "../docs/create" %}}).

## CLI Options
