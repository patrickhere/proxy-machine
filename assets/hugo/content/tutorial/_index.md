Ever wanted to make your own custom card game? How about making proxies for your favorite TCG?

It's easy to make cards with a cutting machine and I can show you how!

Why use a cutting machine though?

You could do it by hand with a craft knife, a rotary cutter, or a paper guillotine, but it's not easy. Some cards will be too tall, too fat, off angle, or off center. Plus, your body will be sore after the whole ordeal.

Join me in the 21st century where we have technology to solve our problems!

With the press of a button, a cutting machine can do all the hard work for you. Each card comes out exactly the same, **perfectly sized** and **perfectly centered**. It even does the **rounded corners** for you! No more manual work required.

Don't believe me? Watch me cut **104 cards in 26 minutes** without breaking a sweat!
