# Lorcana Plugin

This plugin reads a decklist, automatically fetches card art from [Lorcast](https://lorcast.com) and puts them in the proper `game/` directories.

This plugin supports decklist exports from [Dreamborn.ink](https://dreamborn.ink). To learn more, see [here](#formats).

## Basic Instructions

Navigate to the [root directory](../..) as plugins are not meant to be run in the [plugin directory](.).

If you're on macOS or Linux, open **Terminal**. If you're on Windows, open **PowerShell**.

Create and start your virtual Python environment and install Python dependencies if you have not done so already. See [here](../../README.md#basic-usage) for more information.

Put your decklist into a text file in [game/decklist](../game/decklist/). In this example, the filename is `deck.txt` and the decklist format is Dreamborn (`dreamborn`).

Run the script.

```shell
python plugins/lorcana/fetch.py game/decklist/deck.txt dreamborn
```

Now you can create the PDF using [`create_pdf.py`](../../README.md#create_pdfpy).

## CLI Options

Dreamborn format.

#### Enchanted Artwork

You can select the Enchanted artwork by adding `*E*` at the end of the card line.
